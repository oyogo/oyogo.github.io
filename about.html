<h2>About me</h2>


<p>
Hello there ! My name is Clinton. I love data science, nature, calm music and reading books.

I am currently working as Junior data scientist at World Agroforestry Centre. My day to day tasks revolve around data wrangling, data analysis, visualization, dashboard development and spatial data analytics. This I do using R, Python, SQL, QGIS among other tools.

I have Bachelors degree in Statistics from Jomo Kenyatta University and a professional data science certificate with IBM.
