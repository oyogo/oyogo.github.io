# Insightful analytics blog  
Sharing is caring !  
I have compiled the documentations and articles I have written into a blog for the sake of sharing what I've learnt peradventure someone finds it useful. 
It has helped me severally whenever I've wanted to make reference to the steps/approaches/procedures I took in writing code, developing softwares and analyzing data.  
This repository contains the files for the blog which I have created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
